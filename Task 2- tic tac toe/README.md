# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

This is a Python-based **Tic-Tac-Toe** game where a user can play against an AI. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to make optimal moves, ensuring that the AI is unbeatable. The game is played in a terminal/console window with a simple text-based interface. The user plays as "X," and the AI plays as "O."

## Features

- **Unbeatable AI**: The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to make the best possible moves.
- **Interactive**: The user plays as "X" and the AI plays as "O." The user can input their moves via a numeric grid (1-9).
- **Game State Output**: The current state of the board is printed to the console after every move, and the winner is announced when the game ends.
- **Draw Detection**: The game will notify you if thereâ€™s a draw.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need to have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. No additional libraries are required for the basic version of the game.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-ai.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd tic-tac-toe-ai
    ```

3. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed by running the following command:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

4. If you want to use the GUI version (optional), make sure you have the **Tkinter** library installed. Tkinter is included by default with Python 3.x, but if it's not installed, you can install it by running:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python3-tk
    ```

## Running the Game

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory if you're not already there.
3. Run the game with the following command:

    ```bash
    python tic_tac_toe.py
    ```

    If you're using **IDLE**, open `tic_tac_toe.py` and press **F5** to run the game.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game against the AI. You'll be asked to input your move (a number from 1 to 9 corresponding to the positions on the board).
